#Stability Analysis using Root Locus
##Aim:
To analyse the stability of the system having open loop transfer function, G(S)=K/(S(S+2)(S+4)) using root locus and verify it using MATLAB. 
Apparatus Required:
Computer with MATLAB software

##Theory:



##Procedure:
	Open MATLAB software
	Open a new script file.
	Type the program.
	Save and Execute the program.
	Click on the crossing point of the root locus to find the value of K and poles at the crossing point.
	From the value of K, analyse the stability.

##Program: 


##Result:
Thus the root locus for the given transfer function was drawn and verified using MATLAB. The conditions for stability is ------------
